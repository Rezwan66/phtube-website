                <p>
                    JavaScript is a dynamically typed language which means that we can simply use `var`, `let`, and
                    `const` directly to assign variables without indicating their types. However, `var`, `let`, and
                    `const` each have different scopes and characteristics.
                </p>
                <ol class="list-decimal">
                    <li><strong class="text-lg">var:</strong>
                        `var` is <b>function scoped</b>, which means that they can be accessed anywhere inside a
                        function after they are declared, even in another function which maybe called inside that
                        function. `var` is also <b>global scoped</b>, which means that after declaration, they can be
                        accessed anywhere throughout the whole script, and even re-declared. This might cause problems
                        in a large script where a developer might need to declare a lot of variables inside or outside
                        functions and do a lot of mathematical calculations.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong class="text-lg">let:</strong>
                        Both `let` and `const` are <b>block scoped</b>, which means they can only be accessed within the
                        block of code they are declared in. If any variables/parameters are declared inside a specific region (e.g. inside
                        curly brackets `{}` of a function) they cannot be called outside that scope. If they are declared at the very
                        beginning of the script, at the outermost block, they can be accessed throughout the block.
                        Moreover, `let` and `const` cannot be re-declared so they are more useful for larger scripts
                        with a lot of functions and variables. But `let` differs from `const` in one crucial way, that
                        it can be <b>re-assigned</b>. This means that variables declared with `let` can be edited
                        according to need, and hence, they are perfect for numerical calculations such as keeping the
                        count of a variable inside a loop and changing it every time.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong class="text-lg">const:</strong>
                        `const` variables have a lot of similar behaviours to `let`, like they are also <b>block
                            scoped</b>, and they cannot also be re-declared. However, `const` does not allow re-assign
                        of the values of the variables, which means that the values stay constant, which is also very
                        useful in large code spaces. But, arrays or objects declared using `const` still retain some of
                        their functionalities like 'push', 'pop', or changing object property values.

                        <strong class="text-lg">undefined:</strong>
                        In JavaScript, an `undefined` variable is a variable which hasn't been initialized. For e.g. if we define <code class="mx-auto">let name;</code> and don't assign a value to it, it is set as `undefined`. In the same way, if we define a function but do not return anything from it, that function is also `undefined`. For e.g. <br><code>const handleSum = () => {2+2;}</code><br> Morover, if we call a function which takes some parameters as input, but do not pass it any arguments, the values of those function parameters are set as `undefined`. For e.g. <br><code>const sum = (a,b) => a+b; <br>sum(); // the values of a and b in the function call are set as undefined</code><br> Similarly, an empty return of a function, a non-existent property of an object, an index call of an array outside it's index-range, deleting an array item, all these actions lead to `undefined` values. A variable can also directly be declared as undefined. In JavaScript, <code>typeof undefined</code> is undefined.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong class="text-lg">null:</strong>
                        `null` is defined as the absence of value of a variable. It is a primitive JavaScript datatype like `undefined`, and is used in many cases to set the initial value of a variable to null or nothing, so that it can be changed later accordingly. In JS, <code>typeof null</code> is object. Both `null` and `undefined` are <b>falsey</b> values which return false in case of a condiiton.

                    REST API methods are a series of C.R.U.D.(Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations which can be performed on an API resource database, with the help of a server. There are a handful of very useful REST API methods which are briefly discussed below.
